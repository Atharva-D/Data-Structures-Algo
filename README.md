# 👨‍💻 Data-Structures-Algorithm 👨‍💻 

This repo contains solutions for famous coding questions with a gist of data-structures and approach used.
All the questions choosen have unique approaches.
This repo later can also be used for revision purpose during placements.

# Contribute

Write any algorithm of your choice in c++ only.<br>
Steps to follow :
1. Create an algorithm file with algorithm name. For example for kruskal algorithm create file like kruskal_algorithm.cpp
2. Write the approach for the problem and then code it.
3. Add that file in the folder of that particular topic. For example kruskal algorithm  will go in Graph folder.
4. Open a pull request.

# Criteria for getting your PR merged
