This repo is for the solutions from mixture of all sheets on internet in detail with the gist of approach used.
All the questions choosed have unique approaches.
Later on this repo can be used for revision purpose during placements.
Happy Coding !!

Write any algorithm of your choice in c++ only.<br>
Steps to follow :
1. Create an algorithm file with algorithm name. For example for kruskal algorithm create file like kruskal_algorithm.cpp
2. Write the approach for the problem and then code it.
3. Add that file in the folder of that particular topic. For example kruskal algorithm  will go in Graph folder.
4. Open a pull request.
